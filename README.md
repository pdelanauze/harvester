# Harvester

CouchApp with a Node.JS process to fetch pages scraped through the jsdom plugin.
Scraping login coded with jQuery ( how fun :) )


# TODO
Insert instructions here ;)

Should be somewhere around the lines of soca push && node node/scraper.js

# Issues

- Recursivity needs to be dealt with. There is a possibility that the fetcher will recurse infinitely in certain scenarios.
